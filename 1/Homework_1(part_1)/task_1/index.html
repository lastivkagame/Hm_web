            <h1>Vehicle</h1>
            <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><span>[1]</span></sup>) 
                is a machine that transports people or cargo.
                Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles 
                (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles
                (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats),
                amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),
                aircraft(airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><span>[2]</span></sup><br/><br/>
                Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply 
                streering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled,
                tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standart, 
                also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types,
                terms and definitions.<sup><span>[3]</span></sup>
